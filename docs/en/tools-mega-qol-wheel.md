# Tools — Mega QoL — Wheel Keys

## What it does
On mouse wheel down, sends a configurable sequence of keys (1–4) with an optional delay. Burst suppression ensures only one sequence per scroll burst.

## Setup
1. Tools → Mega QoL: enable Wheel→Keys.
2. Configure sequence (e.g., `1,2,3,4`) and delay (ms).

## Notes
- Respects focus policy and allowed processes.
- Designed to avoid flooding when the wheel is scrolled quickly.
