# Copy Overlay

**English** | [Русский](../ru/copy-overlay.md)

## Overview
Displays a live cropped portion of the screen as an overlay. It can stay always visible or appear only when linked buffs/debuffs are absent.

## Setup
1. Open **Library → Copy Areas** and add a new entry (capture rectangle, size, position, transparency).
2. Optionally link the copy area to tracked buffs/debuffs for conditional visibility.

## Usage
- Toggle the copy overlay from **Overview** or the floating dock.
- When conditions are met, the captured region updates in real time inside the overlay window.

## Tips
- Hovering the overlay hides it so you can click what is behind it.
- During positioning, drag to move and use the mouse wheel to resize while keeping a square aspect ratio.
