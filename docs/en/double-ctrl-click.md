# Double Ctrl Click

**English** | [Русский](../ru/double-ctrl-click.md)

## Overview
Double-press Ctrl to start continuous left-click emulation; releasing Ctrl stops it. Rising-edge detection prevents auto-repeat from triggering the action twice.

## Setup
1. In **Tools → Mega QoL**, enable **Double Ctrl Click** as needed.
2. Confirm your focus policy and allowed process list match the desired behavior.

## Notes
- Works only when the game is focused (or when the app window is focused if focus gating is disabled).
- The floating dock indicator shows whether click emulation is running.
