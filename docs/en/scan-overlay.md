# Scan Overlay

**English** | [Русский](../ru/scan-overlay.md)

## Overview
Mirrors tracked buff or debuff icons inside the configured scan area and renders them as lightweight, non-activating overlays.

## Setup
1. Open **Library → Buffs / Debuffs** and add the icons you want to monitor (image, size, position, transparency).
2. In **Settings → Select Area**, capture the region of interest (ROI) where the icons appear.

## Usage
- Start the scan from **Overview** or via the floating dock toggle.
- The app continuously looks for saved icons within the ROI and shows overlays whenever a match is detected.

## Tips
- Hovering an overlay hides it temporarily, letting you interact with the UI underneath.
- Use positioning mode to drag or resize overlays; the mouse wheel keeps the shape perfectly square.
