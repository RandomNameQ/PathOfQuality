# Wheel Keys

**English** | [Русский](../ru/wheel-keys.md)

## Overview
On mouse wheel down, sends a configurable sequence of keys (1–4) with an optional delay. Burst suppression guarantees just one sequence per scroll burst.

## Setup
1. Open **Tools → Mega QoL** and enable **Wheel → Keys**.
2. Define the key sequence (for example `1,2,3,4`) and the delay between presses in milliseconds.

## Notes
- Respects focus policy and the allowed processes list.
- Designed to avoid flooding inputs even when scrolling quickly.
