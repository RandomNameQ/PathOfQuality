# Tools — Mega QoL — Double Ctrl Click

## What it does
Double‑press Ctrl to start continuous left‑click emulation. Releasing Ctrl stops it. Rising‑edge detection prevents key repeat from false‑triggering.

## Setup
1. Tools → Mega QoL: enable Double Ctrl Click if needed.
2. Ensure focus policy and allowed process list match your preference.

## Notes
- Works only when the game (or this app, if allowed) is focused.
- Indicator on the floating dock shows click emulation state.
