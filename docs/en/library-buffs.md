# Library — Buff or Debuff Overlay

## What it does
Finds your saved buff/debuff icons on screen (inside the ROI) and displays lightweight, non‑activating overlay mirrors.

## How to use
1. Add items in Library → Buffs / Debuffs (image, size, position, transparency).
2. Configure ROI in Settings (Select Area).
3. Start Scan in Overview (or with the floating dock).

## Notes
- Overlays hide on hover so you can click UI beneath.
- Use positioning to drag/resize; wheel keeps a square aspect.
