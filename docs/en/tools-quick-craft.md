# Tools — Currency — Quick Craft

## What it does
Shows currency overlays near the cursor (global hotkey) or by item. One left‑click on an overlay performs a fast right‑click at the source and a left‑click back at the cursor — all without stealing focus.

## Setup
1. Tools → Currency: add entries (image, capture, active).
2. Tools → Quick Craft: set global hotkey, position templates (center guide), save.
3. Add your game EXE to `assets/allowed_processes.json` for focus‑gated mode.

## Usage
- Press the global hotkey → overlays appear near the cursor.
- Click an overlay once → quick interaction executes immediately.

## Notes
- Overlays are hidden from taskbar/Alt‑Tab and are non‑activating.
- Works when the game is focused (or while this app is focused if focus gating is disabled).
