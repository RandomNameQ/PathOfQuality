# Library — Copy Screen Area

## What it does
Displays a live cropped region of your screen as an overlay. You can set:
- Always show, or
- Conditional show: display when a selected buff/debuff is NOT visible.

## How to use
1. Add a Copy Area in Library → Copy Areas (capture rect, size, position, transparency).
2. Optionally link references to buffs/debuffs for conditional display.
3. Toggle Copy in Overview or the floating dock.

## Notes
- Overlays hide on hover to let you interact with the UI behind them.
- Position/resize with positioning mode; wheel keeps a square.
